<p><strong>Eleven Techniques and Exercises to Manage Stress</strong></p>
<p><strong>STRESS MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Although stress management books and programs offer many educational suggestions, there are only two basic ways to handle stress. First, you reduce the immediate cause of stress. Secondly, you change your life style. To manage your stress, begin by studying the eleven proven stress management techniques stated below. Familiarize yourself with each one and complete the exercise given. Obviously you would not use all the techniques of management for every stressful experience. This way you will have an arsenal of stress management techniques you may apply. Some of these techniques are adapted from Dr. Herb Levitt, Professor Emeritus, California State University, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Now move to the eleven techniques of managing your high stress</p>
<ol>
<!-- 1 -->
	<li><p><strong>DEEP RHYTHMIC BREATHING</strong></p>
		<p>You will often observe certain individuals taking deep breaths just prior to engaging in stressful situations; e.g. the test taker just before starting a test, the major league hitter and pitcher, the keynote speaker at a convention, the boxer between rounds. The benefits of deep breathing are to provide the body/mind with more oxygen and create a more relaxed state. When athletes talk about "choking" under stress, they are literally identifying a shortness of breath and a lack of oxygen which leads to increased tightness and tension throughout the mind/body. Therefore, proper breathing and higher performance go hand in hand.</p>
		<p><strong>Deep Rhythmic Breathing Exercise</strong></p>
		<p>To begin the exercise, imagine a ball of white light entering your body about two inches below your navel. As you inhale through your nose, you will imagine the white light traveling up the front of your body to the top of your head. You will make certain that your deep breaths fill your lungs with fresh air, without raising your shoulders.  With each exhalation, the ball of white light travels down your back. You will exhale through your mouth, allowing all of the air to leave your body. As you let it out, hear yourself make a loud exhalation sound. When the ball of white light reaches your feet, you will have expelled all of the air from your lungs and refilled it with oxygen-right air.</p>
<!-- 2 -->
	<li><p><strong>BEING IN THE MOMENT</strong></p>
		<p>The extent to which one can become absorbed in an activity has a direct effect on the quality of the performance. The nature of this absorption is described as being in the moment.  This experience for the individual allows the mind/body to be free of the clutter of distracting and competing stimuli from the environment. The person becomes centered. There is no concern about future performance, nor is one worried about past performance. When you are totally absorbed in the moment, the world about you takes on a sharper clarity, colors are more distinct, things generally seem to be more in focus, and your ability to process task-related information approaches peak levels.</p>
		<p><strong>Being in the Moment Exercise</strong></p>
		<p>Washing the Dishes; allow the morning and evening dishes to collect, and then approach your task as though it was the only thing that you have to do. Your intention throughout the task is to train your attention on every detail that you can pick up through all of your senses. As you turn the water on, you will feel the temperature of the water, and the weight of the water as it falls gently on your hands. You will watch the water as it hits the plate that you have in your hands, observing the color of the plate and the water as it falls into the drain. Continue through all the dishes without regard to anything but your task at hand, as each moment passes into the next. As your attention is focused, it will leave you feeling more relaxed and serene than when you began the task. Furthermore, you will not even be aware of the passage of time.</p>
<!-- 3 -->
	<li><p><strong>GUIDED IMAGERY</strong></p>
		<p>Guided imagery may be used in two ways, one to help us relax; and two, to make positive image rehearsals of stressful things you need to do.</p>
		<p><strong>Guided Imagery Exercise</strong></p>
		<p>Read the following points, then close your eyes, and imagine you are out at the beach:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Visualize the beautiful blue sky and enjoy the puffy white clouds.</li>
			<li>Look out over the ocean and notice the sailboat on the horizon.</li>
			<li>Watch the waves as they fall gently on the shore.</li>
			<li>Pay attention so that you can hear the children playing in the sand, and the people laughing and enjoying themselves, free of cares and concerns.</li>
			<li>Reach down and feel the sand in your hands, and walk slowly across the sand without your shoes and enjoy the freedom.</li>
			<li>Feel the warmth and comfort of the sun and the sand.</li>
			<li>Smell the salt water and the aroma from a nearby barbecue, which add to your great sense of calm.</li>
			<li>If you want to feel an even greater sense of calm, let yourself remain until you see the sunset with its golden hues. The beach takes on a comfortable stillness as the people leave and you are left with the sounds of the waves and birds as they pass by.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The power and use of imagery is as old as humankind, and each generation has engaged in guided imagery in their unique ways. For example, how Olympic pole vaulters "picture" their maximum performance hundreds of times before actually vaulting.</p>
<!-- 4 -->
	<li><p><strong>POSITIVE SELF-TALK</strong></p>
		<p>Each of us carries her or his own "inner voice," which talks to us throughout our life experiences. Our inner voice converses with us. It tells us about a potentially stressful event that is negative and, therefore, a potentially dangerous one. An example of positive self-talk relates to the discovery of endorphins, the brain's chemical system. These natural pain killers are reported to be like morphine; some are many times stronger. Therefore, with the help of your positive self-talk, your body carries and releases enzymes which are stored at various parts in the brain. Your positive self-talk can even monitor your activities through your immunological system, and can increase your chances for good health.</p>
		<p>It is important you start with the understanding that positive self-talk is just that— positive.</p>
		<p><strong>Positive Self-Talk Exercise</strong></p>
		<p>Please list three of your favorite negative self-talk statements.  Thoughts like "I'm too overweight" or I will never be Regional Manager."  How often do you speak negatively to yourself?  We know that affirmations (positive self-talk) may dictate behavior. In this case, negative behavior also increases our stress.</p>
		<p>Now, stop your negative thoughts.  We suggest your place a rubber band on your wrist.  Snap it each time you negatively talk to yourself.  The next step is to substitute a positive thought (positive self-talk).  Put a rubber band on your wrist and try it out.</p></li>
<!-- 5 -->
	<li><p><strong>POSITIVE MENTAL REHEARSALS</strong></p>
		<p>Guided imagery activates your emotional and mental responses, and can determine your actions. To do this imagery, you will need to bring all of your senses to bear on the experience. When you have created the complete experience in the form of a picture, you are ready to use your images to reduce exstress, and convert it into positive stress.</p>
		<p><strong>Positive Rehearsal Exercise</strong></p>
		<p>To anticipate and head off potential sources of exstress, imagine that your boss has asked you to make a presentation to a large group about a work-related theme. You tell yourself initially that you have never been good at making presentations, that you get petrified in front of large groups, and that you will never be able to complete the presentation without freezing, fumbling, and making a fool of yourself. Furthermore, you might do so badly that you would jeopardize your chances of getting a raise, getting a promotion, and might even get you fired! Then you will run through your savings and eventually starve to death!</p>
		<p>Next, adopt what is termed the "Quiet Attitude." Use this occasion to practice your new found skills, such as the deep rhythmic breathing, and the beach scene to get yourself calm. Then tell yourself that you will take extra time to prepare your presentation, and will practice in front of a mirror, or on video tape. As you mentally rehearse your presentation, complete the "image" of the presentation as an event. In your mind's eye, see the pleasant setting with all the details of the room, and how it is furnished; e.g. whether the chairs are comfortable, and how they are arranged; what kind of decorations are on the wall; where you will be speaking. See yourself delivering the talk to friendly faces who want to hear what you have to say, and who want you to do well. These people really like you, and want to be there. Notice how confidently you go through the whole talk, including the questions and answers period, and hear the applause of appreciation at the conclusion of a job well done. In your mind's eye, the movie you have created is one that you experience as a presenter. Your picture is full of positive self-talk. You will be successful, and your exstress level should be greatly reduced.</p></li>

	<li><p><strong>STRESS BUDGETING</strong></p>
		<p>Stress, like money, can be budgeted when we learn to take the peaks of exstress into consideration— we can budget our stress like we do our finances. Generally, when we budget, we first list the categories of expenses, such as the house payment, the utilities, the groceries, entertainment, etc. Second, after listing the items, we estimate our total need in dollars; and three, apply the total income to these categories, and hope it all comes out somewhat equal. Likewise, we list our categories of exstress. We can compare them to our overload times, and see that certain stressful times are reducible, or changeable, and therefore, they may be budgeted.</p>
		<p>Daily stressors are common, like rushing to be on time to important appointments or meetings.</p>
		<p>How about some of those weekly stressors? For example, Tuesdays or Fridays may be high stress days because the business books need to be balanced, or you must attend that weekly volunteer staff meeting. Compounding all these feelings is the gnawing realization that we have little control over our lives.</p>
		<p>As these daily and weekly stressors build, we soon realize that these stressors are things we face on a monthly basis. If we look far enough in advance, we realize that some things even occur yearly, like the annual Christmas Dinner fiasco, or getting ready for our annual vacation.</p>
		<p>Well, if these daily, weekly, monthly and yearly stressors are not budgeted and planned for, they can become our Achilles Heel. Like the bounced check, or the late finance charge that represents poor financial planning, unbudgeted stress nags at us and takes its toll.</p>
		<p><strong>Stress Budgeting Exercise</strong></p>
		<p>Put These Symbols in Your Calendar to Budget Your Stress...</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A	-	A family day or family appointments<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W	-	Work deadlines<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T	-	Tax Time<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D	-	Decision time on home and work projects<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S	-	Social occasions, a holiday dinner, birthday or anniversary<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F	-	Financial Time – paying the bills<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V	-	Vacation Time<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K	-	Kids commitments<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C	-	Care of others</p>
		<p>If you find these symbols are incomplete, please add any you feel appropriate for your calendar.  Look ahead, and by anticipating and planning, some of the high stress may be taken out of your schedule. Look ahead for each day, week, and month of the year.  Move events around, cancel a few, group several together, and try to put some space between events.</p>
<!-- 7 -->
	<li><p><strong>COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING</strong></p>
		<p>Cognitive restructuring merely means changing the way you think about something. When you tell yourself you have to get something done today, high stress may occur. Then you pause, and you think, "No, I can do that tomorrow," thus you have restructured your thinking and are reducing your stress by reestablishing personal control. Of course other persons—like your boss—may have something to say about your day. But, in those areas where you have a possibility of control, manage it! Restructuring is possible in many situations, returning you to control, and reducing your stress.</p>
		<p><strong>Cognitive Restructuring Exercise</strong></p>
		<p>Let's say you have agreed to go to the theater with a friend over your busiest week of the year, and your commitment has stressed you a great deal.  You need to reconstruct your thinking - you can't do it all!  Call your friend and cancel your theater commitment.  Write what you might say to friend below.</p>
		<p>I'm sorry _________________,<br>______________________________________________________________<br>______________________________________________________________<br>______________________________________________________________.<br></p>
<!-- 8 -->
	<li><p><strong>PHYSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAM</strong></p>
		<p>One way to manage emotions of your exstress is to have an exercise program. Exercise provides a long list of benefits. Feeling good and younger, perhaps, or having more flexible arteries, reduced cholesterol, strengthened heart muscle, increased body image, and improvements in your immune system are but a few. Exercise also allows anger to dissipate, and offers us a sense of well being. Certainly, these are more than enough reasons for us to spend three hours each week in an exercise program.</p>
		<p>Take control, mark your calendar, get an exercise buddy, and reward yourself as you meet benchmarks in your exercise program.</p></li>
		<p><strong>Physical Exercise Program Exercise</strong></p>
		<p>You would like to lose weight, but three things must be kept in mind.  These are your food intake, your metabolic burn rate and your physical exercise program.  Mark your calendar three times a week for 30 minutes each of exercise.  That is your time to exercise, no excuses.  Write in an activity you like to do: tennis, golf, walking, bicycling, or running are a few examples.  Then do it!</p>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reestablishing Control</strong></p>
<p>When a distance exists between our perceived control and actual control, life stresses increase.  For example, if you plan too many things in one day, are overcome by anger when others are not precise enough at work or have too many changes in your life, stress increases.</p>
<p>To reestablish control over your life you now know how you stand on Stresscom and in which of the six areas you need to do a better job of managing your stress.  Use the stress management techniques provided to extend your life and enhance your health and your productivity.  You may choose to return and take your Stresscom assessment again and again by ordering the annual subscription.</p>
<p>Good Luck...  and remember - "The reed never tells the wind what to do."</p>

	<li><p><strong>BEHAVIORAL THERAPY</strong></p>
<p>In certain cases of stress management, therapists rely on operant conditioning techniques. This is a form of learning that occurs when a volunteer response is rewarded, making the response more likely to occur again. For example, a veteran with post traumatic stress may become overly vigilant at night, resulting in sleeplessness.  A desired response is offered, shaped and rewarded to modify the behavior, giving the veteran a better nights sleep.</p>
<!-- 10 -->
	<li><p><strong>BIO FEEDBACK</strong></p>
<p>A licensed biofeedback technician uses relaxation techniques and  electronic equipment to manage patient stress. These techniques are used to control volunteer and involuntary stress reactions.  This process also gives the patient a greater sense of control by allowing the patient to "take" responsibility for stressful behavior.</p>
<!-- 11 -->
	<li><p><strong>MEDITATION</strong></p>
<p>Meditation, an age old form of stress management utilizing mind body exercises. Generally it is practiced using a mantra and a quite place.  It allows the person to step out of the chaotic world by offering mindfullness techniques related to the behaviors leading from the 6 stress areas offered by Stresscom.</p>
